          Animeis hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from
          Japan. Outside of Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to
          animation produced in Japan.However, in Japan and in Japanese, anime a
          term derived from a shortening of the English word animation describes
          all animated works, regardless of style or origin

          One of the key points that made anime different from a handful of
          Western cartoons is the potential for visceral content. Once the
          expectation that the aspects of visual intrigue or animation being
          just for children is put aside, the audience can realize that themes
          involving violence, suffering, pain, and death can all be storytelling
          elements utilized in anime just as much as other media
